# Happy Thoughts (fullstack project) - UPDATED version
The happy thoughts project, now you can finally post HAPPY THOUGHTS
on social media. 

## The problem
The assignement was to produce a twitter-style app using react, an API and POST and practice using the {useEffect} hook. 
All incapsulated and presented in a very early world-wide-web-retro-style. 

## Updated verison, backend added
The project was recently updated with a personal API to 
be able to store the thoughts in a project specific API, instead
of a public one - as previous 

### BACKEND REPO
